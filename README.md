🌾 Crop Yield Prediction / Recommendation System
📌 Overview

This project is a Crop Yield Prediction System built using Machine Learning and deployed with Flask.
The system takes inputs such as Year, Rainfall, Pesticides, Temperature, Area, and Crop Item and predicts the expected crop yield (production) for the given conditions.

It can help:

Farmers choose the best crop to grow.

Policymakers analyze yield patterns across regions.

Researchers explore climate & pesticide impact on production.
